# Clash Royale Prototype Development Plan

## Project Overview
A simplified Clash Royale-inspired prototype to generate game replays for analysis. The game will feature a 1D grid with towers at each end, character cards with attributes, and an elixir system.

## Core Game Mechanics
- 1×10 grid gameplay area
- Towers at each end (lose condition if enemy reaches your tower)
- Character cards with Attack, HP, and Cost attributes
- Elixir system (max 10, +1 per second)
- Turn-based movement and combat
- Replay generation for analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure Setup
1. Create the game environment class
   - Implement the 1×10 grid
   - Add towers at each end
   - Setup turn counter

2. Design the card system
   - Create a Card class with attributes (Attack, HP, Cost)
   - Implement a deck management system
   - Design the elixir management system

### Phase 2: Game Logic Implementation
1. Implement movement mechanics
   - Characters move forward one grid per turn
   - Collision detection with other characters

2. Implement combat system
   - Characters attack when they can't move forward
   - Damage calculation based on Attack value
   - Character death when HP reaches 0

3. Create the turn system
   - Move all characters
   - Process attacks
   - Generate elixir
   - Allow for character placement

### Phase 3: Player Interaction
1. Implement card placement
   - Check for sufficient elixir
   - Place characters on the grid
   - Deduct elixir cost

2. Design simple AI opponent
   - Basic decision-making for card placement
   - Elixir management

### Phase 4: Replay System
1. Implement state logging
   - Record grid state after each turn
   - Log all actions (movements, attacks, placements)

2. Create replay storage system
   - Save replays to file system
   - Implement replay loading functionality

3. Design replay playback
   - Visualize turn-by-turn gameplay
   - Add controls for replay navigation

### Phase 5: Analysis Tools
1. Implement basic analytics
   - Win/loss statistics
   - Card effectiveness metrics
   - Elixir efficiency calculations

2. Create visualization tools
   - Game state heatmaps
   - Card usage patterns
   - Critical game moment identification

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Classes
1. `GameEnvironment`:
   - Manages grid, towers, and game state
   - Processes turns and movement

2. `Card`:
   - Stores card attributes
   - Handles card behavior and interactions

3. `Player`:
   - Manages elixir and deck
   - Handles card placement decisions

4. `ReplayManager`:
   - Records game states
   - Provides replay functionality

5. `Analyzer`:
   - Processes replay data
   - Generates insights and statistics

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Week 1**: Basic structure and game mechanics
2. **Week 2**: Player interaction and AI
3. **Week 3**: Replay system implementation
4. **Week 4**: Analysis tools and refinement

## Getting Started
1. Set up Python environment
2. Implement the basic grid and card system
3. Build turn-based mechanics

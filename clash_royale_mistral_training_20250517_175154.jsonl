{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Title: PERSONALLY, I think logbait, and hog cycle are the only two actual no skill decks.\n\nI know people have said this over and over and I\u2019m probably just gonna get burnt but hear me out.\n\nYou can\u2019t tell me you aren\u2019t tired of seeing these decks. Any hog eq, or basic hog cycle where you can have a 12 elixir pushed demolished by musketeer, log, and ice spirit. All this while hog completely demolishes your tower on the other end. There\u2019s a reason you see this deck so often, it\u2019s because the skill needed is very low, and doesn\u2019t require much thought process. I\u2019ve seen so many below mid ladder players running that deck or some version of it, due to how easy it is to use.\n\nSame goes for logbait. It\u2019s also mostly rng based. If your opponent doesn\u2019t have log in cycle, and doesn\u2019t have a splash card, or anything that won\u2019t result in a negative elixir trade, you win. And all it is, is a bunch of plan b\u2019s. You log my gob barrel? Princess at the bridge. You knight my princess? Gob gang opposite lane. You MK my gob gang? Mini tank and inferno tower.\n\nI just hate these decks because I feel they destroy the fun of clash royale. Once you get to a certain trophy number, you only run into 3 types of decks. Logbait, hog cycle, and some god awful homemade deck.\n\nThe only deck I feel maybe takes even less skill is rg, fisher, monk.

One can\u2019t look at purely damage or health stats to see associations as Wizard and firecracker have different degrees of splash damage and have different ranges. Again Wizard needs a buff but in no way is firecracker taking from what could be Wizard use rates as fire cracker isn\u2019t even being used in decks to clear swarms she is mainly used for her chip damage on towers. And either way firecracker isn\u2019t popular enough to cause a dip in wizards use rates.

Arrows doesn\u2019t have any special use so it makes up for that with high radius and damage which it only has the advantage of killing firecracker and bomber over the others and bomber is a negative elixer trade. Arrows maybe can get another crown tower damage nerf but it won\u2019t change its position cause it\u2019s primarily used for killing swarms and there is no reason it should get a nerf to its damage as that would change too many interactions.

Zap counter literally every swarm in the game with the help of the tower to clean them up(that includes minion horde), barb barrel is a similar story to log, and snowball is so good I know it doesn\u2019t have high usage but I use it and when you know how to use it you can counter a lot of cards. And either way what is your point because the only non ground units that are swarms are bats and minions. Bats get countered by every small spell and minions damn near does too. Arrows can not box out every single one of these spells and each spell has a good use in the meta right now so what point are you even trying to make. Log has double the use rate then arrows right now in the top 1000 players and even lightning has a higher use rate.

While that might seem like a small change, for a card that fires as rapidly and frequently as X-Bow, it definitely had an impact on its overall damage output. However, most notably, it broke a key interaction \u2014 **X-Bow could no longer two-shot Skeletons**.\n\nLuckily, this did not go unnoticed by X-bow players, and Supercell responded quickly \u2014 not only fixing the scaling bug, but also giving X-Bow a **5% damage buff**. As of now, X-Bow **deals 2\u20133 more damage per shot** than it did before the update.\n\nThis 5% buff flew under the radar and might not have even been noticed by players outside of the X-Bow or competitive communities. But what\u2019s more important is that this marks the **first balance change of any kind since December 2020**, for this controversial and often **misunderstood** win condition.\n\n---\n\n# The December 2020 Rework\n\nI\u2019ve talked in depth before about what went wrong with that 2020 rework in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClashRoyale/comments/1isjn79/the_xbow_rework_4_years_later/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but to summarize briefly:\n\nThe rework was as follows:\u00a0\n\n* **Lifetime:** Reduced 40 sec > 30 sec\n* **Hit Speed:** Slower 0.25sec > 0.3sec\n* **Damage:** +30%\n* **Hitpoints:** -4%\n\nIn the end, what this means is that X-bow\u2019s maximum damage output goes from **5120** at level 11, to **4100**. The rework was framed as an \u201coffensive buff and a defensive nerf,\u201d but in reality, it nerfed X-Bow\u2019s damage output by **over 20%**. When a card\u2019s main purpose is\u2026 getting damage, there\u2019s simply no world where lowering that output can ever be considered an offensive buff.\n\nNerfing X-bow in this way completely defeats the purpose of nerfing X-bow on defense with the lifetime nerf. Since offensively, X-bow is worse and less reliable, players will need to play more defensively and rely more on the tie-breaker to win. These are also players\u2019 biggest gripes with the X-bow.\u00a0\n\nSo while I just explained how this rework was a **complete disaster** in terms of balancing, the makings and intentions of a good change are still there. Nerfing the lifetime of X-bow is a helpful change **if and only if the overall damage output stays the same**. So if X-bow were to get a 25% dps buff, we would finally get to see the proper result of this rework.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter this 5% damage buff, we\u2019re **closer** to where X-Bow needs to be \u2014 with its maximum damage output now sitting around **4300**. But that\u2019s still **not nearly enough**, especially when compared to the **5120** it had before the 2020 rework.\n\nThe good news is that this recent buff simplifies the path forward \u2014 and makes the next change easier to stomach even for X-Bow critics. Now, all that remains is to **revert the hit speed nerf**, restoring it from **0.3s back to 0.25s**.\n\nThat alone would bring X-Bow\u2019s damage output back up to **5160**, right where it was pre-rework \u2014 finally making the rework function as originally intended.\n\n---\n\n# Final thoughts\n\nRestoring the damage output of X-Bow is critical in ensuring that it stays balanced and consistent before pursuing further reworks. There is no point in calling the December 2020 balance even a rework when X-Bow ends up dealing **less damage in every situation**. That\u2019s just a straight up nerf which is very questionable to have given to a card that has **never** been strong individually. Especially when this offensive nerf completely undermines the defensive nerfs they gave to it since X-Bow is still forced to have a defensive game plan.\u00a0\n\nPerhaps the task of making X-Bow a balanced and likable card is more complicated than what I am suggesting here (it probably is). But this hit speed buff back to 0.25 seconds is a **very simple change** that is crucial in first evaluating whether or not the original rework was **even functional in the first place almost 5 years later**. If we want to have X-Bow be a healthy win condition, it is only fair that X-Bow is balanced around its original power level \u2014 not the unfairly nerfed state it\u2019s been stuck in ever since."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are you on mushrooms? Bow has the second most top 200 places right now, only overshadowed by RG"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The xbow players spent too long playing a shit card so now they just absolutely dominate when it\u2019s useable"}, {"role": "user", "content": "If we want X-Bow to be good, it should also be a fun win condition to fight, which is very difficult when a building one tile from the bridge is near unreachable. In order for that to happen, the defensive properties of X-Bow and its synergies needs to be toned back. How I would suggest this happen is by nerfing Ice Spirit (less freeze time) and Tornado for 2.9 and icebow, respectively. I would also increase the hitbox size of the X-Bow from the small hitbox size (like Cannon) to the large hitbox size (like spawners), and reduce the range by the same amount so it can hit from the same places. This altogether would make X-Bow harder to defend and easier to reach, causing it to be significantly less frustrating. Once that happens, then the offensive power can be improved more safely. Until that happens, though, I think the X-Bow getting buffed would only make the game less fun."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure. The December 2020 rework did in fact tone back X-Bow's defensive properties. It reduced the lifetime so that it stays on the map for a shorter time. The problem was that this also made X-bow significantly worse on offense since it lowered it's overall damage output. So in the end, the rework just ended up being a nerf across the board since X-bow still has to rely on defense, and in fact, more heavily now since it is now worse offensively. \n\nBuffing the hit speed to restore the damage output like I've done should work to fix this issue and allow us to properly evaluate the effects of the lifetime reduction. So this change should come first before working on other changes. Clearly there is a lot to work on in order to make X-bow a healthy and fun card to play against. I may or may not agree with all of your changes but we should take this first step of reverting the hit speed so that X-bow is balanced before we make more significant changes later on."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I've been getting some downvotes here but that's fine!

It\u2019s not a card that a brain dead midladder player can use and get value with just by placing it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure. I don't think they \"regret\" adding it, but definitely it is a hard card to balance. I speak more about X-bow's flaws in the post I linked but the main criticism players (and supercell too!) have about X-bow are that matches take too long. This mainly stems from X-bow's unreliability as a win condition, forcing players to rely on tie-breaker and spell cycle to win. I mean if you are relying on tie-breaker to win half your matches, what does that say about the strength of X-bow as a win condition? \n\nThis buff makes X-bow a better offensive win condition which should help ease this reliance on the tiebreak, and thus addresses most players' grievances with the card.

However, as we know, the offensive buff ended up being completely false with the damage output **dropping**. I mean if X-bow is dealing less damage to the tower, that is pretty much objectively saying that it is a worse win condition. Since X-bow became worse and less rewarding on offense, players had to play more defensive/tiebreaker etc. Essentially, we never saw the true effects of the lifetime nerf on X-bow. \n\nThe point of this buff isn't to revolutionize X-bow or anything, this is one of the reasons why Supercell doesn't want to touch it. But this is a simple change that will go a long way since they already reworked the card 5 years ago. This is just to make that rework actually functional"}], "metadata": {"post_id": "1knn9ig", "flair": "Discussion", "timestamp": 1747353721.0}}

For example tell yourself, are you actually excited to get a legendary chest and wait 24h to unlock a single card?

You can litterally like 8 legendary cards in one drop if you are lucky. the only bad thing about that was that they limited the daily amount to 3-4 drops.

Therefore, any game where you are unable to deal with the Royal Giant quickly is almost a guaranteed loss, as all they need to do is play the giant in order to get good damage with no counterplay.\n\nIn the past dealing with the Royal Giant was as simple as using a strong swarm, but ever since its evolution it has become much more restrictive to teambuilding. \n\nAs a result, the only cards that actually stop the Royal Giant are those with massive single target damage, like Pekkas.\n\nPerhaps you could also use a combination of cards to try and stop it, like lots of small cards and a tanky building, but this is very unreliable and the opponent can just use spells to support their Royal Giant. There also aren\u2019t that many buildings strong enough to distract the Royal Giant for long.\n\nSo that leaves us with Pekka and\u2026 maybe inferno tower as counters? I suppose inferno dragon counts as well. As a result, most decks lose to Royal Giant unless they can out damage it. \n\nMaybe some spells like tornado would help, but even then they probably wouldn\u2019t save you from taking damage unless you had a way to quickly kill the Royal Giant. \n\nIf you are playing a light cycle deck, the game is lost before you began.

Try placing closer to the middle, keeps splash troops from getting free damage on tower. Like witch and wizard. \n\n3. the cannon and witch defence on their barbarians was pretty much perfect. \n\n4. your counterpush with the witch didnt need the Pekka, you played it too early and gave your opponent a big elixir advantage because bomber isnt able to clear the skeletons out quickly enough. Keeping in mind you had a zap. Which would have worked better if you predicted them (Placed it where you suspect they'll place the card at the same time you think they will. Its a bit tricky to learn, but its quite important to learn predictions) But in general, Pekka is a good defensive card, works great for taking out midsized cards like wizard, barbarians, etc. I would have saved it until the wizard comes to bridge, and then made the push\n\n5. for the prince and witch you had a bit of a poor hand to defend it. No good card to keep the prince busy while valkyrie handles the witch. So you did decent enough given the hand you had available\n\n6. the wizard once again got quite a few cheeky hits on your tower because of the splash. It could have been worth it to let the valkyrie get lower down closer to your tower (to see what else he puts down) and once you see the wizard, place the pekka to kill valkyrie, and then take care of their wizard by either letting the pekka do it. or use bats while the wizard is focusing on the pekka, then build a push out of it\n\n7. dart goblin way to close to bridge, but otherwise you handled this quite well\n\n8. Generally playing your cards around the middle, baits your opponents cards there, its called kiting them. it places your opponents troops in a position where they have to walk a longer distance to your troop (And thus spending more time in your towers dmg range) and then a longer walk back to your tower. Its an extremely important tactic to keep in mind, since it maximizes the value you get out of each card, since you often will end up using less elixir, Try playing the valkyrie around the area where you placed the cannons, in the middle to kite the opponent's troops there.\n\n  \nTry playing your pekka and valkyrie a little more defensively, placing them around the middle (So the opponent's troops walk a longer distance to get to it) and if you need some extra dps on top of that, play dart goblin to help cleaning out. Dart goblin has some pretty good range, so its usually safe to play him a pretty decent distance from the fight itself, You want to place him in a way where its hard to get value from spells on him. Such as log, or arrows, or fireball. He himself is a positive elixir trade for those, but during a big fight your opponent probably wont want to play 3 elixir for arrows to take just him down. \n\nSorry for the wall of text"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You waste too much elixir, as most ppl say.\n\nWitch in the beginning, then again you wasted a cannon when you could defend from barbs with witch only and after that push with pekka at the bridge."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Dont leak at beginning"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Your reaction time is abysmal and you overcommit on every defense.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Title: Balance changes that would like to see in the next patch (based on the current state of the game in high/top ladder)\n\n#\ud83d\udd34 Boss Bandit\n- **HP:** 2803 --> 2508 (-11%)\n- Boss Bandit has been the most prominent Champion since she got added. Definitely the most balanced on release, but after seeing her settle, it can be said confidently that only her health needs to be toned down.\n\n#\ud83d\udd34 Monk\n- **Ability Damage Reduction:** 80% --> 60%\n- Monk's ability gets too much value for 1 Elixir, and his presence in the meta makes it clear. It's supposed to make Monk counter projectiles, but it also makes Monk too good at tanking melee damage as well. This change will make Monk more vulnerable to heavy melee DPS without hurting the main gimmick of the ability. This new value is also the same as the shield of Evo Knight, so bonus points for consistency.\n\n#\ud83d\udd34 Evo Witch\n- **Heal:** 73 --> 65 (-11%)\n- Despite the emergency nerf, the Evo Witch is still a bit too strong, so she needs another nerf to the heal from the skeletons.\n\n#\ud83d\udd34 Ice Spirit and Evo Ice Spirit\n- **Freeze Duration:** 1.2s --> 1.1s\n- Ice Spirit has consistently been one of the best cards in the game, often overshadowing the other spirits. This nerf to the freeze duration would make it more in-line with the other spirits. It also applies to the evolution, which is currently one of the strongest in the game.\n\n#\ud83d\udfe2 Ice Golem\n- **HP:** 1198 --> 1282 (+7%)\n- Ice Golem has been overshadowed by the other mini-tanks for a while, especially since the introduction of evolutions. An health buff should make the card a more appealing choice for fast-paced decks.\n\n#\ud83d\udfe2 Rune Giant\n- **HP:** 2508 --> 2784 (+11%)\n- Her previous nerf was too harsh so it seems fair to partially revert it by restoring her original health points.\n\n#\ud83d\udfe2 Evo Wizard\n- **Added Spawn Damage** with identical stats to the shield burst damage (no knockback)\n- Evo Wizard is one of the worst evolutions in the game and needs desperately some versatility other than just being spell resistant. The spawn damage should help this card in situations where you need a more reactive defence.\n\n#\ud83d\udd35 Goblin Drill and Evo Goblin Drill\n- **Goblin First Hit Speed:** 0.4s --> 0.6s\n- **[Evo] Re-added the Knockback** from the submerges\n- When Supercell nerfed the first attack speed of Goblins to tone down the Goblin Gang  specifically, they left Goblin Drill Goblins untouched for some reason, disrupting the consistency. This rework restores the consistency which is a direct nerf to the base Goblin Drill which is deserved due to its prominence in the meta, while Evo Goblin Drill is getting the knockback restored as compensation since it's currently in a pretty bad spot despite the base card doing well. This should help the evolution being a more appealling option over the base card in Drill decks.\n\n#\ud83d\udd35 Evo Goblin Giant\n- **Goblin First Hit Speed:** 0.4s --> 0.6s\n- **Goblin Spawn Time:** 1.8s --> 1.7s\n- Same thing as Goblin Drill: the Goblins were left inconsistent. Restoring partially the spawn speed of Goblins as compensation.\n\n#\ud83d\udd35 Evo Mortar\n- **Goblin First Hit Speed:** 0.4s --> 0.6s\n- **Mortar First Hit Speed:** 1.0s --> 0.8s\n- Same thing as Goblin Drill and Evo Goblin Giant. Restoring partially the first hit speed of Mortar as compensation.\n\n#\ud83d\udd35 Goblin Barrel and Evo Goblin Barrel\n- **Goblin First Hit Speed:** 0.4s --> 0.6s\n- **[Evo] Decoy First Hit Speed:** 0.4s --> 0.6s\n- **Goblin Spawn Time:** 1.1s --> 0.9s\n- **[Evo] Decoy Spawn Time:** 1.1s --> 0.9s\n- Another rework for the sake of consistency. This rework has effectively no impact on Goblin Barrels played on the tower as the First Hit Speed nerf and Spawn Time buff cancel each other out.\n\n#Let me know if there is something you would do differently and if there is anything you would like to add and why."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sir, I don't want to sleep on Prince any more second.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Title: [Guide] How to actually improve at this game\n\nI've played lots of competive Clash Royale in my life, along with other competitive games. Doing that, I've learned a lot of extremely important things, that I notice really nobody is doing, even at top ladder. I've moved on from competitively playing CR and some of my clan mates showed interest in my knowledge, so I wrote up a guide on how to genuinely reach the top level of Clash Royale, if you actually have the dedication and patience for it. Figured I'd share it here too, even if just one person can take what I've written to heart and apply it, that'll be good enough for me. So anyways for those of you with the attention span longer than a tiktok video and who really do care about wanting to be the best at this game, here's my guide: (If you have any feedback, please leave a comment!)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nFirst off, if you can\u2019t be bothered to read this whole document, then just give up now. I\u2019m just going to write it as it is, without any TL;DR or any of that, so if you really want to be at the top, take the time to read. The most important stuff is at the end though, MAKE SURE you pay full attention to that part especially.\n\n\n\nCR might seem complicated, looking at all the pros like Mohamed Light, Ryley, etc, making these crazy defenses and crazy predictions, but in reality it\u2019s not as difficult as it seems. At the foundation of the game, there are some core concepts, but at the base of it all, it\u2019s just about outplaying your opponent by thinking \u201cwhat is their next move?\u201d and \u201cwhat is my best strategy to beat that?\u201d The main concepts in question are elixir management, card cycles, and damage / elixir economics.\n\n\n\nElixir management: starting off with this one as I\u2019ve seen lots of people talking about \u201celixir counting.\u201d I\u2019ll just flat out say it, don\u2019t do this. It\u2019s a waste of brain space, and to be honest, pretty useless. But knowing when you\u2019re at an elixir advantage and disadvantage is still super important, and you can develop this game sense by seeing patterns in your opponent\u2019s gameplay. For example, if you see your opponent place a royal giant and pekka at the bridge, you know that\u2019s a lot of elixir, and if you counter it with a simple inferno tower and like some skeletons or something, that\u2019s a very cheap counter for a big elixir push. You don\u2019t need to calculate the exact number of your elixir, you\u2019ll just be able to see that your opponent is down a lot because they overcommitted their push into your cheap defense, so if you play a goblin barrel with an ice spirit on one side, and a knight and goblin gang on the other, then you know that they\u2019re down elixir, and won\u2019t be able to defend without taking a lot of damage. The thing you need to look out for though is how they can defend. If they have log in their hand and you spam a ton of pressure swarm units on one side, then they\u2019ll just log it for a +5 elixir trade or whatever, evening it out. So you need to make sure that when you\u2019re taking advantage of your opponent being down elixir, you don\u2019t make the mistake of giving them the opportunity for an easy defense. Another example would be if their tower has like 300 HP left and then they spam the other lane, you can be pretty sure that they don\u2019t have the elixir to defend your push, so you should go all in on the lane with 300 HP and easily win the game, don\u2019t fall for their attempts to distract you. Advantages go both ways though, your opponent could also be at an advantage over you. If you\u2019re at a disadvantage, then generally you should be playing very defensive and careful with your elixir. Like if you overcommitted into your opponent, you shouldn\u2019t keep spamming troops at the river, since you should be expecting them to play very aggressive into you. The reason that playing defensive is better for managing elixir is your princess towers (or whatever tower troop you have). They provide infinite value (theoretically, compared to normal troops) while your opponent\u2019s troops are on your side of the map, or until your tower dies, since they cost 0 elixir. It\u2019s all about using your troops to get the best value for the cost, and since the princess tower has 0 elixir cost, it technically has infinite value, of course time is a factor. So the general rule is when you\u2019re up elixir, play more aggressive. When you\u2019re down in elixir, play more defensive, to abuse your princess towers\u2019 value. And please don\u2019t count elixir, it\u2019s a waste of brain space and time.\n\n\n\nCard cycles: the most important concept. Back in the day I first got to ultimate champion when I was learning these concepts from being coached using golem pump (man I miss that deck being good), so I\u2019m going to use it as an example. A very difficult matchup would be against really any earthquake cycle deck, usually hog rider with firecracker, or royal hogs with archer queen. Either way, my main strategy revolved around building up a big fat push using elixir pumps. So the goal of understanding card cycles is do everything you can to stop your opponent from getting value. Like going for elixir pump when they have earthquake in their hand is dumb, it\u2019s a guaranteed negative elixir trade. Even against other spells, sure it\u2019s technically a +1 elixir trade, but you take tower damage, AND you don\u2019t get to gain that elixir advantage, which is the main strategy of the deck. What I\u2019m trying to get at is value. If I play my pump while they have spells in their hand, or a card like miner or goblin barrel that I don\u2019t have counterplay to currently, then the value is bad. Even if it\u2019s a positive elixir trade, it doesn\u2019t mean the value is good. Like using your log on a princess while you have no other splash cards in your hand is bad value, because they will spam you with swarm cards and you can\u2019t defend it, even though you\u2019re getting a +1 elixir trade on the princess. You need to be tracking your opponent\u2019s cycle and seeing the cards in your hand, and making your decisions to get yourself the most value, and get your opponent the least value. You may be thinking, it\u2019s impossible to track the cycle of all 8 cards my opponent has, and yes, that\u2019s true. But realistically your opponent will only have a few relevant cards. Like against hog earthquake when I\u2019m playing golem pump I need to keep track of earthquake, firecracker, and hog rider, since those are really the only 3 cards that are scary to me (pump when no earthquake, tornado on firecrackers, barbarians for hog riders). Another thing to mention is champions grant 3 card cycle. What this means is that if someone has a champion down on the field, they only need to play 3 cards, instead of 4, to get back to the card they just used. So against something like royal hogs archer queen, I have to be careful of the opponent cycling 2 royal deliveries when his archer queen is down, cus he can spam way more. The downside though is that you don\u2019t get the champion back in your hand until it dies, AND THEN you have to play 3 more cards, because it gets added to the end of your card cycle, so you need to be very careful using your champions, as you won\u2019t be able to cycle back to another one for a while. But anyways in general the point is you just always need to be thinking \u201cI need to save this card in my hand for when my opponent plays that card,\u201d and \u201cMy opponent just used that card, I\u2019m safe to play this card,\u201d and then keeping in mind how champions affect it.\n\n\n\nDamage / Elixir Economics: Clash Royale is an economy game in a sense. The 3 things you have to manage are time, tower health, and elixir. The end goal is to win the game no matter what, and managing those 3 are the key to success. Time isn\u2019t as important as the others, but definitely keep an eye on when you\u2019re getting close to the tiebreaker, and then also just like timing with card interactions and stuff (that you will just develop mostly through experience). The more important part is managing tower health and elixir. You can imagine them as stocks, both contributing to your overall portfolio. You want your portfolio to be as big as possible (best chance for winning the game), and each of the 2 stocks are worth different amounts at different times, and generally you should be prioritizing the one with less value, as it\u2019s the easiest to grow. To put this into CR terms, for example let\u2019s talk about tower health. If you have max tower health on your towers, and your opponent\u2019s towers are lower, then your tower health is pretty valuable, there\u2019s not too much need for concern. But if your towers are low and your opponent\u2019s are healthy, your tower health is doing terribly, and you really need to fix that. Same goes with elixir, if you\u2019re up elixir or have a big counterpush (troops on the field also contribute to your elixir, obviously they contribute less if they have less health or are just going to get killed easily), your elixir is pretty valuable. But if you are down elixir or your opponent has a big counterpush, your elixir is doing bad. So to link these together, we have to think about managing them. Let\u2019s say the opponent plays goblins at the bridge, and I have a knight pushing the bridge on the other lane, with a goblin barrel and a log in my hand, and 3 elixir, so I can\u2019t play both, and my opponent has 1 elixir. Should I defend his goblins with my log, or place a goblin barrel with my knight? Take a second to think about that. (Seriously, stop reading and just take a second to think through what\u2019s a better option). The correction option would be playing my goblin barrel, here\u2019s why: yes, I will take some damage from the goblins, but realistically not that much, causing a little bit of hurt to my health. But, my elixir portfolio is doing really well (I am up elixir and have a knight counterpushing, making me up even more elixir), so if I invest my elixir, it will go down, but my damage will go up, since he has nothing to defend my knight + goblin barrel push. Whereas if I decided to log his goblins, then I would\u2019ve lost out on all that value from the damage on the right side. So yes I\u2019m taking a bit of damage and taking a hit on my elixir (putting myself at a -1 elixir disadvantage), but I\u2019m trading that for getting a big amount of damage on the right side, potentially even taking his tower, so overall my portfolio (of damage and elixir stocks) is going up. The point here is you need to understand that tanking damage on your towers can be used to gain more damage on your opponent\u2019s towers, or give yourself an elixir advantage to gain more damage on your opponent\u2019s towers. At the end of the day, your goal is to win the game, which means dealing more damage to your opponent\u2019s towers than they deal to yours.\n\n\n\nDeck archetypes: shorter section here, but basically depending on your deck, there are different kinds of playstyles. Beatdown is build up big pushes, bait is punishing opponents when they have no counters in hand by baiting out their counters, cycle is cycling cheap cards to defend while spending a bit of elixir to pressure with win conditions, siege / control is defending with minimal damage taken and then attacking at the right moments (mortar / xbow / miner control). These are just some brief descriptions, but the point is different decks have different playstyles, and you need to pick one. Literally just pick a playstyle, if you\u2019re not sure, then try them out and see what you like. Watch some pros play it on youtube to see what it\u2019s like at a high level, and pick a playstyle. Then go on RoyaleAPI and find the best deck to that playstyle (that you have the card levels for), and that is now your deck. Every deck archetype, and even every single deck with small variations, has an insane amount of different situations you will be put in. So if you\u2019re not already at the top of the game, you should be focusing on one deck. By playing this one deck you will learn all the core concepts of CR (the stuff mentioned above. My point is don\u2019t change your deck every season like a lot of people do (I myself have done that many times), trust me when I say it hurts your progress a lot. You can get good at any deck by swapping every month, but if you truly want to master it, you need to stick with it, even through the bad metas.\n\n\n\nMatchups: A tale as old as time, \u201cHe hard counters me!\u201d But seriously, you need to know your matchups. This goes along with the previous point on sticking with a deck, but seriously, you need to figure out how to play against different matchups, and be thinking about that as soon as the game starts. As soon as your opponent plays a card, you need to be thinking about what deck they might have, and how you want to play around that, so you\u2019re not wasting time thinking about it later during a high pressure situation.\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n**\u2757IMPORTANT\u2757**\n\nHow to actually be the best: I\u2019ve explained a lot of the core concepts of CR, but how to actually take these things and apply them to your game is the thing almost every player in CR is missing. **You need to be learning from your mistakes.** That is literally the most important and simple summary of everything I\u2019m saying. What I used to do, and what most people do, even in the top 1k, is when they lose a match, they\u2019ll remember and think \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t have wasted my log on that princess,\u201d and then do better next time. Which does work, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t. But doing this, some things you will only learn after a ton of reps, that\u2019s where your brain will finally remember it during the high pressure situation. I\u2019m sure in school you\u2019ve been told to write notes, people saying you\u2019ll remember things better. I cannot stress this enough how incredibly powerful writing things down is. After every game, write down your mistake(s), and just take a few seconds to visualize it back in your head, or go into the replay if you can\u2019t remember, and just think about it / watch it back a few times. Yes this is an annoying process but this will literally take you like 30 seconds - 1 min, and you\u2019re giving your brain more reps to remember it. If you make that mistake once every 100 games, it\u2019ll take a lot of games for you to learn it, but if you make it once, and think / watch it over a few times, you\u2019ll learn it way faster. If you think that I\u2019m crazy or that this is too much effort, then give up. **Because the truth is, to be at the top, you need to be better than everyone else, so you need to do something that other people aren\u2019t doing, and I am telling you, this is by far the most effective thing you can do.** Not only just writing down your mistakes, but you should also reinforce the good plays you make. If you see a play you made that you think is really good, just try and remember why you made that play, and just reinforce it in your mind that you should keep doing that. Reinforcing your good plays is also really important for your mental, which I\u2019ll be talking about later. The other thing you should be writing is your general game plan in certain matchups. Before I mentioned you should be thinking about a game plan, but trust me, if you just write down your game plan, then you can literally just recall it, or even just read it, going into your match, so you can think about what your opponent is about to play, rather than trying to remember your strategy. It shouldn\u2019t be some super in-detail plan, but just some general outlines. For example, for playing golem pump against giant graveyard, I would say: Go for pump in front of my king tower to avoid graveyard hitting it, and only when up elixir / have barbarians in cycle to defend. Obviously that\u2019s a pretty easy matchup so the notes on it would be short, but you get the idea. Another thing you should be doing is watching pros who play your deck, or made a video on your deck. The great thing about youtube and twitch is you can learn so much from it. You can learn so much from your own gameplay, but you can also learn so much from the pros. The truth is, the best thing to do is both. Literally spend like 15 min minimum each day watching pro gameplay, and writing down what they\u2019re doing right / wrong. They know way more about the game than we do, so by studying them, you can learn so much. This also gives you those nice mental reps without actually playing yourself. **My point is you NEED to be writing down your mistakes after every game, and thinking / watching them over a few times, to really get it solid into your brain, along with also just having a written general game plan against different matchups, and studying pros gameplay.**\n\n\n\n**\u2757IMPORTANT\u2757**\n\nMentality / emotions: these are so unbelievably important. What you need to realize is that to be a master at anything in your life, you need to train yourself, and a lot of it. Clash royale is a strategy game, meaning that your performance is completely based around your brain. This separates it from most popular competitive games, which involve some sort of mechanics (most commonly aim). On the one hand it makes it nice that you don\u2019t need to put in insane hours training basic mechanical skills, but on the other, it means you can\u2019t be bailed out of tricky situations with said mechanical skills. In CR, the only thing you need to train is your brain. The 2 biggest factors are memory / decision-making and emotions. Memory / decision-making I already talked about in the previous section about how to learn and all that, but emotions are equally as important. **Being tilted is your worst enemy.** For those who don\u2019t know, being tilted just means you lost and the emotions are getting to you, making you play badly, and making you tilt down in trophies / the leaderboard, whatever it is you\u2019re playing. Emotions are great, they make us feel happy, and protect us from eating poisonous food, and make us care about other people, all sorts of useful and amazing things. But for CR, they SUCK. But there\u2019s ways to work around them. I\u2019ll just say right now, flat-out, if you\u2019re not focused, close the game. No questions asked. Don\u2019t ever just open your phone, open CR, and click battle on ladder. If you\u2019re too tired to focus, don\u2019t play. It is so, so important that your mind is clear when you\u2019re playing. Don\u2019t play after something upsetting has happened, don\u2019t play when people are making a bunch of noise around you, don\u2019t play when someone\u2019s talking to you. Unless you\u2019re just playing a random game for fun, it\u2019s also really important to have fun in the game too, to keep that passion and drive going. But seriously when you\u2019re playing to get better, you need to be 100% focused. So for general life things, get a good sleep, eat good food, get some exercise every day (doesn\u2019t need to be the gym, just go outside on a walk or something), trust me, you will feel better, and you will perform better, as your brain will be healthier, meaning you will have a clear mind, and be able to think better. And no scrolling social media. All that is is an unnecessary distraction, you don\u2019t want to be playing a really important match for #1 in the world, and suddenly remember a cute cat video you saw, and then oops your tower\u2019s gone. And let\u2019s talk about another big mental trap: blaming RNG or bad matchups. Do not blame something on luck or a bad matchup, ever. If you do, that\u2019s ok, it just means it\u2019s time to take a break from playing. Yes, hard matchups exist, but there is always, ALWAYS something you could\u2019ve done to win. If a matchup is 90% against you, that means you still have a 10% chance to win. If you want to be at the top, you need to strive to win that 10%. You won\u2019t always win it, but over time, you\u2019ll do better. If you\u2019re ever thinking that you had a bad matchup just ask yourself, would Mohammed Light have lost this like I had? Probably not. He\u2019s not perfect either, but he definitely would\u2019ve done better, and that\u2019s what you need to strive for, as there is ALWAYS a chance to win in every matchup, I can promise you that, and you need to not forget that. Another thing to mention is that when you\u2019re playing CR, you will get tired, you will get frustrated sometimes, and that\u2019s completely OK. I said we could work around our emotions, not suppress them. All it means is you NEED to take a break. Like seriously, when you feel yourself start to lose focus, or feel frustrated, or hungry, or super tired, stop playing the game. All you will be doing is making your progress worse. Not only in the moment where you\u2019ll perform worse and lose trophies / rank, but also then you\u2019ll make bad plays, and sometimes get away with it, and then your brain will learn that it\u2019s a good play to make since it worked, and you\u2019ll keep repeating the same mistakes. So seriously, turn off the game when you aren\u2019t feeling fully focused and completely chill with your emotions. Every single time you load up the game, have a positive attitude. Just tell yourself you\u2019re excited to play, and that you\u2019re excited to be better. Everything I\u2019m telling you isn\u2019t a magic pill that will instantly get you to the top. You need to be consistent with your practice / learning. You will get out of it what you put into it. If you play every day while you\u2019re pissed, then you\u2019ll get a lot of tilting out of it. But if you try your best and focus every day, and put in the hard work, you will see success. All these things I\u2019m talking about are difficult, I know. It\u2019s not for everyone, it\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want to put in that effort. Just be aware that without putting in the effort, you won\u2019t be at the top.\n\n\n\nSummary: If there\u2019s one thing this entire guide is built on, it\u2019s this: **you won\u2019t become the best by doing what everyone else does.** The top players don\u2019t just play more, they think deeper, train smarter, and just generally put in more and harder work than everyone else. Master CR isn\u2019t about counting elixir or copying decks off Youtube. It\u2019s about understanding how to get the most value out of every card, every trade, and every push. And then repeating that process with complete focus, day after day. It\u2019s about learning from your mistakes, writing things down, reviewing your games, and studying the pros. It\u2019s about choosing a deck and sticking with it until you know every matchup, every micro-decision, and every card in detail. **But above all, it\u2019s about mastering your mind.** If you play while tilted, distracted, or if you\u2019re making excuses, you\u2019re not learning, you\u2019re reinforcing bad habits. The moment you stop blaming matchups, bad luck, or distractions, and start taking full responsibility for every game, that\u2019s the moment your climb truly begins. Being the best doesn\u2019t require some secret talent, or playing insane hours on end, or buying some new broken card / evolution. It requires consistency, discipline, and a level of focus most players aren\u2019t willing to give. Want to be the best? Prove it. Do what no one else is doing. Think harder, train smarter, play with purpose. And never, ever battle without a clear head and a clear goal."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hey I truly read this entire comment, and you mentioned things I never thought of before.

Even if you have evo knight and evo cannon lots of meta cards can beat you down fairly solidly. However all the same if I had any suggestions it's to not be scared to use graveyard on defense against mega knight and boss bandit jumps/dashes. It is your win condition but doesn't mean it has to solely be put in the opponents end. Another suggestion would be to maybe add either bowler or goblinstein instead of baby dragon for added defense against ground cards"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "do you think with goblinstein it would be better? how do you defend air? poison + ground tank?\n\nty for the advice"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Simply put yes.

The best advice I can give is what you probably already know: defend and counter push. You basically NEVER wanna start the action, you wanna react to it. Well\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t say never, more like 70% of the time.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go for defensive poisons. A poison on defense combined with barb barrel kills witch, wizard, and distracts others for that all-important split second. In my opinion the defensive poison on the bridge is the most underrated play with this deck. Splashyard SHINES when you clog up a lane, so tombstone with ice wiz and bbd, with a poison thrown in just eats whatever they throw at you, and eventually you\u2019ll bleed them of elixir, and then you\u2019ll have a counter push that you can throw a graveyard on if you want.\n\nObviously not every game is like this, but you get the idea. Splashyard is a bit outdated, like the other guy said, but still very good. The evo witch is by far the biggest issue that the deck faces, so if you\u2019re facing a lot of those, I really recommend switching decks until it gets nerfed tbh.
